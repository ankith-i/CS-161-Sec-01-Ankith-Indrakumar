## Core Engine Algorithms/AI Schemes

1. Utilizes a backtracking algorithm for solving the map coloring puzzle, suitable for demonstrating constraint satisfaction problem-solving.

## Market Space and Selling Points

1. Aimed at the educational market, targeting puzzle, computer science, and mathematics enthusiasts.
2. Offers educational value through interactive problem-solving and insights into algorithmic thinking.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend Technologies

1. **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface. React's component-based architecture enables efficient updates and rendering.
2. **HTML/CSS**: Used within React components for structuring and styling. Modern CSS frameworks or custom styles ensure a polished look.
3. **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Adds interactivity, state management, and event handling.
4. **Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS (optional)**: For developing responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

### Backend Technologies

1. **Flask**: The backend framework handles HTTP requests, API endpoints, game logic, user authentication, and database interaction.
2. **Python**: The primary language for backend development, including the puzzle solver algorithm.
3. **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: SQLite for development; PostgreSQL is recommended for production on Heroku.
4. **Flask-Login/Flask-JWT-Extended**: Manages user sessions and authentication, with JWT for secure API communication.
5. **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: The ORM tool simplifies database operations.
6. **Heroku**: Hosts the full-stack application.
7. **Git**: Manages version control and facilitates deployments through Heroku's Git integration.
